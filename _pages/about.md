I'm a rising senior majoring in ORIE at Cornell University College of Engineering, with a minor in CS. My undergraduate research concentration is big data and machine learning in the field of healthcare resource allocation and population segmentation, under the instruction of Professor Madeleine Udell of Cornell ORIE department.

I'm actively looking for internship or reserch opportunities in data science and machine learning
field. My programming language skill includes fluency in Python, R, Java, Julia, Ocaml, and Linux
shell script. I have taken courses in ORIE, CS and math, including optimization, stochastic process,
statistics and probability, number theory, computer vision, and messy big data.

For extra curricula activities at Cornell, I'm an active member of Cornell Undergraduate Research
Board and Cornell University Chorus.
